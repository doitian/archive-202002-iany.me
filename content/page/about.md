I'm Ian Yang, Partner and CTO of [3pjgames][1]. I also worked for [Groupon][2], [Intridea][3], [iZENEsoft][4] and [Augmentum][5] before.

I focus on game design and development now, especially the techniques to deliver high performance back-end.

I also did several years web development for POS and payments system, as well as server-side application development in field advertising, information retrieval, machine learning and data mining.
